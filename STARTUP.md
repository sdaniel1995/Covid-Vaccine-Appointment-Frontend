# Getting Started

To edit  and use the code do a `git clone https://github.com/sdaniel1995/Covid-Vaccine-Appointment-Frontend.git` in the terminal inside the the file folder directory on you local machine where you want the code cloned to.
- Open VS Code and open the folder.
- Run the following command: 
    - `npm install (in a package directory, no arguments)`
        -  By default, npm install will install all modules listed as dependencies in package.json. With the --production flag (or when the NODE_ENV environment variable is set to production), npm will not install modules listed in devDependencies. To install all modules listed in both dependencies and devDependencies when NODE_ENV environment variable is set to production, you can use --production=false.
